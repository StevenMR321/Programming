        <h3>1.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>Programming</strong>It is the action of programming that involves ordering, <br> structuring or composing a series of chronological actions to meet an objective.<br> Programming can be applied to social events, media and the computer world of <em>computers.</em></p>
        <h3>2.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>In computer science</strong>programming is the use of computer languages to print <br> desired functions and processes onto a computer system. Programming a computer<br> is the way to tell the <em>computer </em> what to do.</p>

        <h3>3.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>A programming language</strong>is, in computer science, the tool for automating <br> and actions through a computer. The best known programming languages are: Basic (1964),<br> C++ (1983), Python (1991), Java (1995), C# (2000),<em> among others.</em></p>
        <h3>4.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>Programming</strong>is one of the stages for the development of a program or software.<br> Programming specifies the structure and behavior of a program by checking whether <br> it is <em> working properly or not.</em></p>

        <h3>5.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>programming</strong> includes the specification of the algorithm defined as the sequence <br> of steps and operations that the program must perform to solve a problem. <br> For the algorithm to work, the program must be implemented in a compatible and correct <em>language.</em></p>
        <h3>6.PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p><strong>Programming</strong>also refers to a set of events, activities, or television programs grouped <br>together on a specific day or time. Programming is usually in written <br> and chronologically ordered <em> format.</em></p>
